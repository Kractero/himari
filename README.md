# Hare Dumps

The Hare dumps. The latest two regional and nation dumps, stripped to the minimum attributes required to run what is necessary.

Attributes will be added as necessary if needed.


# ledger

A site to view data about

1. the top 100 cards players stats, including bank, deck value and more. All data is sortable either descending or ascending.
2. living status of legendaries

New data is generated every 1 AM PST and previously generated ones can be searched and viewed.

## Q/A

### What is that confusing sort order?

Great question!!! No idea to be honest. I wanted it to be better, but at the moment, it sorts default CTE first, then non CTE, and you can then sort it further by season which will show cards with the sorted season that CTE, cards with the sorted ceason that are not CTE, cards without the sorted season that are not CTE, and cards without the sorted season that are CTE.

### Why 1 AM PST?

I have a repo generating the data needed for the cte checker running at midnight PST based off NS nation dumps which should be made at 10:30 PST, this offset is to ensure they exist.

### Why doesn't that repo also just run the script after so it is guaranteed to exist?

Great question!!!
